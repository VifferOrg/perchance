The Skullstone has long been a bastion of dark arts and sinister practices. Twenty years ago, the formidable archmage Carnage seized control, wresting the Skullstone from its previous master in a bloody coup. 

The grounds surrounding Skullstone are a charnel field, the earth teeming with the restless dead—skeletons, zombies, and ghouls stirred by necromantic energies.

BDSM practices are rampant throughout the Skullstone, woven into the very fabric of its existence.
