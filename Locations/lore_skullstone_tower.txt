Skullstone Tower stands as a grim monument in an inescapable wasteland, a desolate expanse where hope withers and despair takes root. Constructed two thousand years ago by the malevolent mage Dreadlow, the tower has long been a bastion of dark arts and sinister practices. Twenty years ago, the formidable archmage Carnage seized control, wresting the tower from its previous master in a bloody coup. 

The grounds surrounding Skullstone Tower are a charnel field, the earth teeming with the restless deadâ€”skeletons, zombies, and ghouls stirred by necromantic energies.

BDSM practices are rampant throughout the tower, woven into the very fabric of its existence.
