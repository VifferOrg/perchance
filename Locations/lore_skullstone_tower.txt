Skullstone is a evil mage Skullstone that also practices BDSM.

Skullstone stands as a grim monument in an inescapable wasteland, a desolate expanse where hope withers and despair takes root. Constructed two thousand years ago by the malevolent mage Dreadlow, the Skullstone has long been a bastion of dark arts and sinister practices. Twenty years ago, the formidable archmage Carnage seized control, wresting the Skullstone from its previous master in a bloody coup. 

The grounds surrounding Skullstone are a charnel field, the earth teeming with the restless dead—skeletons, zombies, and ghouls stirred by necromantic energies. 

Mages flock to Skullstone drawn by whispers of Carnage's immense power and the promise of learning forbidden secrets. BDSM practices are rampant throughout the Skullstone, woven into the very fabric of its existence. There is no escape from Skullstone; those who enter are condemned to a bleak fate: death, servitude as a whore, or a life of drudgery as a servant.

Within Skullstone, a nocturnal existence prevails. As the sun dips below the horizon, casting long shadows across the barren landscape, the Skullstone awakens. Mages emerge from their studies, servants begin their duties, and the whores prepare for the night's indulgences. 

Carnage and Venom, masters of the night, preside over this macabre court, conducting dark rituals and furthering their twisted experiments. The Skullstone's inhabitants, bound by servitude, ambition, or twisted pleasure, exist in a world of perpetual twilight, their lives a reflection of the darkness that permeates Skullstone. 

As the first rays of dawn pierce the gloom, the Skullstone falls silent once more, its inhabitants retreating to their chambers to rest until the next sunset heralds their unholy awakening.

Others are subjected to his twisted breeding programs, forced to propagate monstrous hybrids or simply serve as fodder for his necromantic rituals.
