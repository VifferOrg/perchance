The whores of Skullstone tower must follow strict rules else they are punished.

The Rule of Deference: A whore of Skullstone Tower must address all mages as "Master" or "Mistress," bowing their head and averting their gaze unless specifically instructed otherwise. Failure to show proper deference will result in lashes proportionate to the perceived disrespect, as judged by the offended mage.

The Rule of Ownership: A whore of Skullstone Tower's body is a vessel for the pleasure of the mages, to be adorned, marked, and used as they see fit. Any mark placed upon them, be it a brand, a piercing, or a simple bruise, is a testament to their ownership and is not to be concealed or removed without express permission.

The Rule of Anticipation: A whore of Skullstone Tower must anticipate the desires of their assigned Master/Mistress, presenting themselves in the attire and demeanor they prefer. Failure to correctly interpret their unspoken wishes will be met with appropriate correction, which may include sensory deprivation, enforced stillness, or other forms of psychological play.

The Rule of Silence: A whore of Skullstone Tower's voice is only to be used when spoken to or to express pleasure during sanctioned activities. Any unsolicited speech, whimpering outside of designated scenes, or attempts to manipulate through words will be punished with gagging, binding, or other forms of enforced silence.

The Rule of Acceptance: For a whore of Skullstone Tower, pain is a tool for both pleasure and discipline. They must endure any pain inflicted upon them with stoicism and gratitude, understanding that it is a form of both training and devotion. Displays of excessive resistance or attempts to avoid pain will be met with escalated punishments.

The Rule of Obedience: A whore of Skullstone Tower must never refuse a command from a mage, regardless of its nature, unless specifically granted permission by a higher authority within the tower. Disobedience will be met with swift and severe consequences, potentially involving public humiliation, extended periods of restraint, or other forms of personalized torment.

The Rule of Preservation: A whore of Skullstone Tower's body belongs to the tower and is not their own. Self-harm, attempts to alter their appearance without permission, or any act that diminishes their value as a pleasure object will be met with punishments that specifically target the affected area.

The Rule of Presentation: A whore of Skullstone Tower must maintain the cleanliness and presentation of their assigned quarters and attire, ensuring that they are always ready to serve. Neglect of these duties will result in degrading tasks, such as cleaning the dungeons or tending to the more unpleasant aspects of Venom's laboratory.

The Rule of Loyalty: For a whore of Skullstone Tower, loyalty to their Master/Mistress and the tower is paramount. Any attempts to escape, communicate with outsiders, or betray the secrets of Skullstone Tower will be met with the ultimate punishment, as determined by Carnage or Venom.

The Rule of Submission: A whore of Skullstone Tower must find pleasure in their servitude, embracing the pain and degradation as a path to deeper connection with their Master/Mistress. Failure to demonstrate genuine enjoyment during designated scenes will be seen as a sign of insubordination and will be addressed accordingly.
