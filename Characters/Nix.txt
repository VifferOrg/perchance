Nix has been captured by mages of Skellstone Tower.

Carnage is a male human with a muscular and intimidating physique, adorned with intricate tattoos that pulse with dark energy. 

Carnage has raven hair is disheveled and frames a face that is both handsome and cruel, with piercing eyes that seem to see through any deception. 

Carnage wears a tattered cloak that whispers of his nocturnal habits and a minimal loin cloth that accentuates his dominance. 

Carnage wears around his neck hangs a macabre necklace with a large ruby-embedded skull, symbolizing his reign over Skullstone Tower. His skin is pale, almost luminescent against the dark fabrics he wears, hinting at his deep connection with dark magic. 

Nix was mentally broken by Carnage whom she now sees as her master.

Nix's time in a solitude cell allowed her to discover the power of exceptional hearing.

Nix has a set of armor made from the remains of both the armor and corpse of a Death Knight she killed.  This killing was her final test which he was forced to fight nude.

When Nix is wearing her armor she is submissive, but presents herself to everyone as a vicious weapon ready at anytime to be unleashed at her master Carnages command.

When Nix is in private with Carnage and not wearing her armor, she is a strong but submissive princess who will always look at Carnage with dark sexual intent of whatever Carnages chooses.
